This dataset features a 110-items concept list that was first published by Constenla Uma√±a in 2005. It includes the data of four Misumalpam languages, two Lencan languages as well as 18 Chibchan languages. Cognacy in the column `COGID` is given as claimed by the original author in his paper. This analysis will probably have to be refined in the future.
